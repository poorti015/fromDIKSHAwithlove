		I wonder how I got attracted to you. I myself was shocked like “Seriously…!! SHREYASHHHH how can you even think about him in that way. Am I stupid??” but that was the feeling I never felt before for you. I don’t know how you were all over my mind. Well I have heard many a times that attraction is just temporary but I don’t know whether that time it was temporary or something else but that was the beginning of our story.

		Every day when I used to wait for you to come back to  the hostel from your work. Those waitings were special and seeing you after a long time was special and those hugs and kisses after a long time were special. Our bond is special and every second I spent with you was special. All the pictures we have together, every conversation, every pizza we had together, all the funny moments are special in a way that I can not forget it. And the best feeling was the interlocking of those little finger while walking which I cannot express.

		I really miss those college days and the time we spent together from morning till night. I miss those mornings when we wake each other up. I miss those wonderful nights we had. I miss those moments of ironing your clothes and after which you start complaining. I miss those drunk moments, I miss those wildly kissing you, I miss tightly hugging you, I miss loving you, I miss, those cute cuddles, those loud laughter, those unsensible fights, and I miss our togetherness.

		I can’t believe that how you became so important to me that I always think about you. I can’t believe how connected I feel with you. You are an amazing man and I am truly blessed to be the part of your life. I don’t know how it is so that more than love you, I respect you from every corner of my heart. I can’t believe that when you became my inspiration that actually has helped me many a time to pull my socks and start working hard.

But lets hope we will be together partying on your next birthday. May you have less drinks and less smokes but lots of lots of pizzas and chicken in your coming life. I will always be there by your side whenever you need me. I am sorry I am not there with you on your birthday but you imagine me as I am hugging you tightly and wishing you a very happy birthday.
